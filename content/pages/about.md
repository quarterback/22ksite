I’m a generalist with deep experience working where policy, services, and digital systems meet. I’ve spent the past two decades rebuilding vital digital infrastructure to better service the public, working with senior stakeholders to navigate complex spaces, all while providing good energy and a solid soundtrack along the way. These days, I’m Director of Design at 18F. 

Outside of work, I coach high school tennis, serve on the Portland Historic Landmarks Commission, and will gladly introduce you to Pesäpallo or beat you at skeeball.
